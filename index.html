<i class='white'>Twisted Curls </i>
</h3>
<p class='red'>
He's twisting his hair <br>
He's little and scared<br>
Sitting in chairs<br>
that are brittle and frail<br>
He whispers and stares <br>
He wishes and swears<br>
He riddles and dares<br>
himself to care <br>
about the whistles and bells<br>
that come in the mail<br>
To him, everyone else's ideas are stale<br>
He doesn't want to follow<br>
He wants to leave a trail<br>
He's timid and fair<br>
He has rhythm and flare<br>
He keeps it hidden, never written<br>
and it's simple and rare<br>
He has stories that are far too cryptic to share<br>
Content that will allow his artistry to thicken in layers<br>

<h3> 
<i class='white'>Synapses </i>
</h3>
<p class='green'>
The hypnosis is broken and he's on to his next class<br>
He's noticed as open and things go through his head fast<br>
Completely oblivious of his eccentric abnormality<br>
Concretely insidious and is affected by remote galaxies<br>
Lightning quick synapses firing within each neuron<br>
Sighting is inactive, tiring him when it turns on<br>
He begins to vigorously strike the paper with astonishing speed<br>
He depicts the bitter and sweet, writes the nature of commons in need<br>
Immediate surroundings are non-existent when in this occasional trance<br>
The shape of the man, the sensational dance from another world <br>
are transcribed by the rage in his hands<br>
When aware, he's calm and enjoys to write<br>
about the toys he liked back in the day <br>
and the void inside that laughs in his face.<br>
He records his thoughts, his dreams,<br>
His plots, and his schemes<br>
The connection he has with foreign worlds is beyond anyone's knowledge<br>
Recollection, he lacks<br>
His soaring blurs fit eons and he runs college<br>
Inking down the myriad of lemures that continue to haunt his brain<br>
Thinkin' 'bout the fear he had and the words that he should use to draw his pain<br>

<i class='white'>It's been a While </i>
</h3>
<p class='blue'>
It's been a while since I've seen any stars<br>
As the sun's cavalry, they battle me and teach me a lot<br>
They leave me with scars<br>
Then flee and depart<br>
They've given me the ability to see in the dark<br>
Another diagnosis of potent psychosis<br>
Medicines are impediments<br>
They riddle me soulless<br>
Leave in solace<br>
In the middle of the park<br>
Losing sleep, outside<br>
In search for a star<br>
